This directory contains the notebook for training an agent to play flappy bird with only the RGB representation of the game. I tried to implement the D3QN with conv layers and some tricks to increase the learning speed but unfortunately the time is still too high for my basic GPU x). Nevertheless, I want to share with you my version of the flappy bird learning problem (if it can help someone) and I hope I will be able to realize it soon :).
